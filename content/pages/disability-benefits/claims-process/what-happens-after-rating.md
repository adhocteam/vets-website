Have you gotten a decision notice from us that confirms your disability rating (our rating system that measures how bad your disability is)? If yes, you may be able to get VA support (known as disability compensation or benefits). This may include financial support (monthly payments) as well as other benefits—like health care or job training.

If you haven’t gotten your decision notice:
- [Check your status on eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=va-letters), or
- [Contact your local VA or eligibility office](/facility-locator/).

#### When will I get my first payment? 

If your notice shows at least a 10% disability rating, you'll get either a direct-deposit payment or a check within 15 days of your decision notice. If you don’t get a payment after 15 days, please call the Veterans Help Line at 800-827-1000.  

#### What if I disagree with my disability rating?

If you disagree with your disability rating, you can file an appeal. You'll need to file your appeal within 1 year of getting your decision notice. [File an appeal](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).

#### How do I get other benefits?

- **For Health Care:** If you served on active duty—and weren't dishonarably discharged from the military—you may be able to get VA health care. This includes access to VA doctors and care, plus medical equipment, prosthetics, and prescriptions. [Apply for VA health care](https://www.vets.gov/healthcare/apply/).
- **For Life Insurance:** If you're in good health other than your disabilities caused by service in the military, you can buy Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance (S-DVI)—a government life-insurance policy. [Apply for S-DVI](http://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/s-dvi.asp). Or, call 800-669-8477.
- **For Education Benefits:** You can get VA support for college or job training under special programs. [Learn about education benefits](/education). Or, talk with a VA education counselor to find out what benefits you may be able to get.   
- **For Dependent Benefits:** If you are 30% or more disabled due to a disability caused by service in the military, you can get more financial support and benefits for your dependents. There are 2 ways to register:
  - [Register through eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation), or
  - [Register through your local VA office](/facility-locator/).
- **For Other Benefits:** Check with your local or state VA offices for other benefits you may be able to get—like help with buying a home or making changes to your home to make it more accessible, or help with getting a job. [Find a VA office near you](http://www.va.gov/statedva.htm).  


#### How do I get benefits that cover specific disabilities?

- **If you have a 100% disability rating**, you may be able to get:
  - [Dental care](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/dentistry/), and
  - [Access to commissaries and exchanges](http://www.militaryonesource.mil/shopping?content_id=268500) (stores located on military bases that offer savings on groceries and other household items)
- **If you can’t work due to your disability caused by service in the military**—even without a 100% rating—you can apply for individual unemployability. [Learn more about individual unemployability](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).
- **If you need modified clothing because of your injuries**, you may be able to get money to buy new clothes. [Learn more about the clothing allowance benefit](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/clothing/).


#### How do I make sure I keep getting my benefits?

To make sure you keep getting your benefits, you'll need to update your information with us any time something happens if your life that might affect your disability rating or payment, like:
- You move and have a new address
- You get married or divorced—or your spouse dies
- You have a child
- Your disability gets worse

#### What do I do if my disability gets worse?

If your disability gets worse, you can file a claim to get more benefits. To update your information:
- [Go to eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=dependent-compensation), or
- [Contact your local VA or eligibility office](/facility-locator/).
